## Introduction  
This repo, is all about exploring the theory behind statistical methods used in A/B testing. A/B testing is like a smart experiment where you compare two versions of somethingâ€”like an ad, a webpage, or a priceâ€”to see which one works better. Iâ€™m talking about this because itâ€™s a super useful way to make decisions based on data, especially if youâ€™re into marketing, designing products, or running an online business. It helps you figure out what really works for your customers without guessing!

## Why Iâ€™m Discussing This  
I chose to dive into this topic because understanding the theory behind A/B testing can save time and money. Instead of just trying things randomly, these statistical methods give you a clear way to test ideas and prove whatâ€™s effective. Whether itâ€™s improving sales, tweaking a website, or testing new features, knowing the basics helps you avoid mistakes and make smarter choices.

## What Iâ€™ll Cover  
  - **t-test:** Compares the average results of two groups (e.g., two ad versions) to see if the difference is real.  
  - **Z-test:** Similar to t-test but for larger groups, like email open rates.  
  - **Chi-square:** Checks if thereâ€™s a link between two categories, like design and purchases.  
  - **ANOVA:** Compares more than two groups, like different pricing options.  
  - **Mann-Whitney U:** Works with uneven data, like session times on different devices.  
  - **Bayesian:** Uses probabilities to test small samples, like acceptance of an offer.  
  These tests rely on ideas like independent samples and equal variance to give reliable results.
